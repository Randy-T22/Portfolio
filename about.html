            <p class="about-me-text">I am Randy Trullet, a student at Base Camp Coding Academy, an eleven month-long program that aims to guide Mississippi high-school graduates into the computer programming field while also teaching professionalism within the workplace. At Base Camp, I am the Manager and one of the writers for the Documentation Team, which serves as the face of the school by creating posts for our social media accounts and following up with any guest speakers we may have. From the material I have gone through already, I have mainly enjoyed the backend side of programming, and would be interested in learning about application development as well.</p>
